sombreros.exe - sample version of FirstButton, which will install a sombrero-shaped button in the 3rd position 
 on the Internet Explorer toolbar. (Unless there are non-Microsoft buttons to the left of that, in which case
 it will install to the left of the non-Microsoft button, so that it appears as far to the left as possible.)
